## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Every command has one key, declared once, and none fires while typing

The system SHALL declare each keyboard command once, with its key and its label, on the screen or overlay that
offers it, and SHALL draw every key hint, each screen's key bar and the key list that `?` opens from those
declarations. It SHALL match a key by the physical key, whatever the keyboard layout, and SHALL treat Mod as `⌘` on
macOS and `Ctrl` elsewhere. An open overlay SHALL take every key before the screen beneath it, and the screen before
the keys offered everywhere. While focus is in a text field, no command SHALL fire but `Esc`, `Mod+↵`, `Mod+Z`,
`⇧Mod+Z` and `Mod+K`, and the field SHALL keep its own editing keys. `Esc` SHALL close an open suggestion list first,
then leave the field, then close the top overlay, then go back on the screen, and SHALL never close a billing alert.
No key SHALL spend money.

A key typed into a field is text, never a command; a list drawn from the declarations cannot disagree with the keys.
Option is the window manager's on Linux and types characters on macOS, and a layout moves letters but not keys.

```
keydown ─▶ in a text field? ─ yes ─▶ Esc · Mod+↵ · Mod+Z · ⇧Mod+Z · Mod+K, else the field's own
               │ no
               ▼
           top overlay ─▶ screen ─▶ everywhere        the first that declares the key runs
```

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Sources are chosen in the file dialog, and each shows its own upload

The system SHALL take sources through the browser's file dialog, sending each file in its own request, and SHALL show
for each its upload's progress, then its reading, then whether it is ready, converted, refused or not cleaned, with
the reason. Import SHALL stay disabled, with its reason, until every chosen file is read, and SHALL commit only the
ready files and those the operator chose to import as they are. Each upload SHALL keep its own state, whatever its
name; an upload SHALL be refused once Import begins committing; and a file whose reading fails SHALL be refused
alone, the next file still read. While Import commits, the sheet SHALL take no file, no second Import and no
cancel, by button or by `Esc`.

Each file's bar answers which one is slow; each reason sits on the file it concerns, so two files of one name are
two uploads. A file that lands while the folder is committed would be dropped from the batch unseen, and a cancel
then would delete the folder the commit is moving.

#### Scenario: each file shows its own progress, then its result
- **Key:** `ui:sheet:each-file-shows-its-progress`
- **Layers:** e2e
- **WHEN** files are chosen in the dialog
- **THEN** each tile shows its upload, then its result
- **AND** a refused file names its reason

#### Scenario: import waits for every file to be read
- **Key:** `ui:sheet:import-waits-for-reading`
- **Layers:** e2e
- **WHEN** a chosen file is still being read
- **THEN** Import is disabled, naming how many are read

#### Scenario: an imported batch opens its hub
- **Key:** `ui:sheet:an-import-opens-the-hub`
- **Layers:** e2e
- **WHEN** Import is pressed on a new batch

#### Scenario: a staged file serves its preview
- **Key:** `ui:sheet:a-staged-file-serves-its-preview`
- **Layers:** unit
- **WHEN** a staged file's preview is asked for
- **THEN** a downscaled JPEG of it is served
- **AND** nothing of it is kept

#### Scenario: the stream reports each file's reading
- **Key:** `ui:sheet:the-stream-reports-each-files-reading`
- **Layers:** unit
- **WHEN** an uploaded file is read

#### Scenario: two uploads of one name keep their own states
- **Key:** `ui:sheet:two-uploads-of-one-name-keep-their-own-states`
- **Layers:** unit
- **WHEN** two files of one name are uploaded to one import, and one is refused
- **THEN** each upload is reported under its own id

#### Scenario: an upload after Import is pressed is refused
- **Key:** `ui:sheet:an-upload-after-import-is-refused`
