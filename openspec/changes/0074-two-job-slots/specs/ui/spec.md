## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Prepare runs what changed as one job, and refuses before it starts when Ollama does not answer

The system SHALL run Prepare as one job over every assigned cell with no sheet: for each flow, the tagging, reading
and sheet stages, each one invocation of the pipeline's own verb over that flow's cells. One job of each kind, a Prepare
and a render, SHALL run at a time, the two side by side in any batches; a job SHALL keep running when its page closes;
Stop SHALL interrupt the current stage of the job it names and start no other, leaving the other job running;
stopping the surface SHALL interrupt every running job; each line a job's verbs write to the batch's log SHALL name
its job; and a stage that fails having reported nothing SHALL end the job
as failed, naming the batch's log, and start no other. Before any stage starts, the surface SHALL check that the
local model server answers, and SHALL refuse with its message, starting nothing, when it does not. While Prepare
runs, the job strip and Prepare bar SHALL show completed cells out of the accepted total and elapsed time; the total
SHALL stay fixed, a cell SHALL count as completed only at sheet, and elapsed time SHALL tick every second.

The pipeline's verb is the one path, so Prepare is exactly what the verbs do. Prepare runs on the local models and a
render on a rented GPU, and they write no file in common, so neither waits for the other. A refusal before the start
leaves every cell assigned, so pressing Prepare again is the whole fix.

#### Scenario: Prepare runs each stage over the assigned cells
- **Key:** `ui:prepare:prepare-runs-the-assigned-cells`
- **Layers:** e2e
- **WHEN** Prepare is pressed with cells assigned
- **THEN** each cell reaches sheet
- **AND** no cell outside the assignment changes
- **AND** while it runs, the strip and bar show matching totals and ticking elapsed time across a reload, and Render
  is offered beside it

#### Scenario: a second job is refused while one runs
- **Key:** `ui:prepare:one-job-at-a-time`
- **Layers:** unit
- **WHEN** a job is asked for while another of its kind runs
- **THEN** it is refused naming the running job

#### Scenario: Prepare refuses when Ollama does not answer
- **Key:** `ui:prepare:refused-when-ollama-does-not-answer`
- **Layers:** unit
- **WHEN** Prepare is asked for and the local model server does not answer
- **THEN** it is refused with the reader's message
- **AND** no stage starts

#### Scenario: Stop interrupts the job
- **Key:** `ui:prepare:stop-interrupts-the-job`
- **Layers:** unit
- **WHEN** Stop is asked for during a stage
- **THEN** that stage is interrupted and no later stage starts
- **AND** cells already at sheet stay at sheet

#### Scenario: a stage that fails before it reports ends the job
- **Key:** `ui:prepare:a-silent-failure-ends-the-job`
- **Layers:** unit
- **WHEN** a stage exits in failure having reported no item
- **THEN** the job ends as failed, naming the batch's log
- **AND** no later stage starts

#### Scenario: totals count cells rather than stage reports
- **Key:** `ui:prepare:totals-count-cells-not-stages`
- **Layers:** unit
- **WHEN** assigned cells report tagging, reading, sheet completion and a refusal
- **THEN** each cell counts once in the fixed total and only cells reaching sheet count as completed
- **AND** a repeated completion never increments the count again

#### Scenario: a render runs beside a Prepare
- **Key:** `ui:prepare:a-render-runs-beside-a-prepare`
- **Layers:** unit
- **WHEN** a render is asked for while a Prepare runs
- **THEN** both run, and Stop of the render leaves the Prepare running

#### Scenario: stopping the surface interrupts both jobs
- **Key:** `ui:prepare:stopping-the-surface-interrupts-both`
- **Layers:** unit
- **WHEN** the surface stops while a Prepare and a render run
- **THEN** both are interrupted, and the render's window closes before the surface exits

#### Scenario: the log names each job
- **Key:** `ui:prepare:the-log-names-each-job`
- **Layers:** unit
- **WHEN** a Prepare and a render write to one batch's log
- **THEN** each line begins with its job's name


### Requirement: The page is told of a job as it runs

The system SHALL serve an event stream that, on every connection, sends a snapshot of both job slots, the Prepare and
the render, and, when a batch is named, that batch's hub, and then sends each change as the job's stages report it. A
running Prepare snapshot SHALL carry its accepted total, completed count and start time. A hub opened while the slot
holds its batch's failed Prepare SHALL show that job's message until Discard on that batch's hub dismisses it in that
page. A page SHALL hold one event stream, naming the batch its screen shows and the import it has open, and SHALL
open it again when either changes. When the surface stops, its streams SHALL end before the server's graceful wait
expires, without cancellation errors; a terminal interrupt SHALL exit quietly after cleanup.

A reload or a second tab gets the whole truth at once; a job's progress reaches the page as the verbs report it. A
job outlives its page, so a failure that happened while no page was open is still told. Every connect brings a
snapshot, so a stream opened again loses nothing, and one connection a page leaves the browser's others free.

#### Scenario: a connection starts with a snapshot
- **Key:** `ui:events:a-connection-starts-with-a-snapshot`
- **Layers:** unit
- **WHEN** the stream is opened for a batch
- **THEN** its first event carries both job slots and that batch's hub

#### Scenario: a stage's report reaches the stream
- **Key:** `ui:events:a-stages-report-reaches-the-stream`
- **Layers:** unit
- **WHEN** a running stage reports an item done
- **THEN** the stream sends that cell's new stage

#### Scenario: a reconnect keeps Prepare progress
- **Key:** `ui:events:a-reconnect-keeps-prepare-progress`
- **Layers:** unit
- **WHEN** a connection is opened while Prepare has completed part of its work
- **THEN** its snapshot carries the same fixed total, completed count and start time as the running job

#### Scenario: stopping ends open streams quietly
- **Key:** `ui:events:stopping-ends-open-streams-quietly`
- **Layers:** unit
- **WHEN** the surface receives a terminal interrupt with event streams open
- **THEN** the streams end within the graceful wait and the surface exits with status 130 without cancellation errors
- **AND** a running job is interrupted and its cleanup and recovery messages remain visible

#### Scenario: a hub opened after a failure shows it
- **Key:** `ui:events:a-hub-opened-after-a-failure-shows-it`
- **Layers:** unit
- **WHEN** a hub opens while the slot holds its batch's failed Prepare
- **THEN** the Prepare bar shows the job's message
- **AND** once Discard dismisses it, a hub opened again in that page does not

#### Scenario: one stream follows the batch and the import
- **Key:** `ui:events:one-stream-follows-the-batch-and-the-import`
- **Layers:** unit
- **WHEN** a page opens a batch, then an import inside it
- **THEN** it holds one stream, opened again naming the batch and then the import too
- **AND** the stream it closed is the only other one it opened

#### Scenario: a job event fills its kind's slot
- **Key:** `ui:events:a-job-event-fills-its-kinds-slot`
- **Layers:** unit
- **WHEN** a render's event arrives while a Prepare runs
- **THEN** the page holds both jobs, each in its own slot


### Requirement: Render is confirmed in a dialog that quotes what renders, its limit and its price at most

The system SHALL offer Render from a bar on a batch's hub and its Renders view that counts the images short of their
approvals' counts, and SHALL show no such bar when none is short and no count is refused, nor on the hub while changes
wait for Prepare. The bar SHALL be disabled, with its reason, when a render runs, when a pod may still be billing, when
no RunPod key is in the surface's environment, and when an approval's count is refused. It SHALL open a dialog
listing per offered flow the images that will render and what is left out, with the reason, the session's estimate
and limit, and its price at most — the limit at the hourly maximum `gpunit.toml` names, with the volume at its
configured rate. Its confirmation SHALL be the only act that rents; the dialog SHALL hold no URL. The confirmation
SHALL carry the limit and the number of images the dialog showed, and SHALL be refused, starting nothing, when the
batch's quote taken again has a longer limit or another number of images. The bar SHALL show the newest offer
asked for, whatever order the answers arrive in.

The quote is what the operator agrees to; gpunit refuses a card above the hourly maximum, so the price is a bound and
not a guess. A reload never reopens a confirmation that spends; a changed image total or longer limit requires
a fresh confirmation, even where the limit sits at its floor or cap. An equal-total change of sources or approvals
is outside that comparison. A bar that is absent needs no reason, and one forward action holds the screen's accent;
a refused count keeps the bar, so the refusal is never silent.

#### Scenario: the dialog lists what renders per flow
- **Key:** `ui:render:the-dialog-lists-what-renders`
- **Layers:** unit
- **WHEN** a batch's quote is asked for with approvals short of their count in two flows
- **THEN** it lists each flow's images and what is left out, with the reason
- **AND** it carries the estimate, the limit and the price at most

#### Scenario: without a key Render is disabled
- **Key:** `ui:render:without-a-key-render-is-disabled`
- **Layers:** unit
- **WHEN** the surface's environment holds no RunPod key
- **THEN** Render is disabled, naming the fix

#### Scenario: nothing short disables Render
- **Key:** `ui:render:nothing-short-disables-render`
- **Layers:** unit
- **WHEN** every approval in a batch already has its count of images
- **THEN** the batch's Render offer counts no image
- **AND** it names why

#### Scenario: Prepare takes the bar first
- **Key:** `ui:render:prepare-takes-the-bar-first`
- **Layers:** unit
- **WHEN** a hub has images short and changes waiting for Prepare
- **THEN** the Prepare bar shows and the Render bar does not
- **AND** with nothing waiting the Render bar shows, and with nothing short neither does

#### Scenario: a refused count is shown
- **Key:** `ui:render:a-refused-count-is-shown`
- **Layers:** unit
- **WHEN** a batch's only approval short of its count holds a count no render takes
- **THEN** its Render offer counts no image and carries the refusal, naming the file
- **AND** the Render bar shows, disabled, with its reason

#### Scenario: the confirmation starts the render
- **Key:** `ui:render:the-confirmation-starts-the-render`
- **Layers:** e2e
- **WHEN** the dialog's Render is confirmed
- **THEN** the session's page opens at `/b/<batch>/sessions/<id>`

#### Scenario: a quote that has grown is refused
- **Key:** `ui:render:a-grown-quote-is-refused`
- **Layers:** unit
- **WHEN** Render is confirmed with a shorter limit, or fewer images, than the batch's quote now gives
- **THEN** the confirmation is refused, naming that the quote changed
- **AND** no job starts

#### Scenario: a stale offer is dropped
- **Key:** `ui:render:a-stale-offer-is-dropped`
- **Layers:** unit
- **WHEN** an older offer request is answered after a newer one
- **THEN** the bar keeps the newer offer
