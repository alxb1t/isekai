## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: The source pane shows the caption one sentence to a block

The system SHALL render a caption's prose as one block per sentence rather than as paragraphs, and SHALL
derive that division in the browser from the prose it already holds, without a request and without a
second copy of the rule.

The complaint this answers is specific: *"I read the paragraph, go to the sheet, add a tag, come back —
and I have lost where I was reading."* A block boundary at every sentence gives the eye something to
return to, and it costs nothing, because the prose is already in the browser and the surface already
owns one rule for how a caption is divided. Putting the second rule beside the first is what stops the
two drifting; putting it on the server would send prose across a socket to be split and sent back.

Splitting on sentence-ending punctuation is naive against abbreviations and decimals. That is accepted
as a known edge rather than an unknown one: the prose is constrained by briefing to plain description of
a person, and the acceptance looks for it specifically.

#### Scenario: a caption is shown as sentences, not paragraphs
- **Key:** `ui:source:the-caption-is-shown-one-sentence-to-a-block`
- **Layers:** unit
- **WHEN** an input whose caption is a multi-sentence paragraph is opened
- **THEN** each sentence is rendered as its own block
- **AND** the prose's own text is unchanged, with nothing added, dropped or re-ordered

### Requirement: Both tag lists are shown beside the prose, read-only, and neither is editable there

The system SHALL show, beside the caption, the scored list the local tagger produced and the
committable tags the hosted tagger offered, and SHALL make neither list a way to change a sheet.

**The two lists are narrowed differently, and the asymmetry is measured rather than chosen.** The local
tagger is scored against the vocabulary it emits, so every tag it returns is committable by
construction and all of them are shown, with the confidence beside each — a wrong tag sorted below a
right one refutes itself. The hosted tagger free-associates: on the acceptance batch roughly nine in
ten of its tags were outside the vocabulary, could not be committed to any field, and the operator's
verdict was that only the marked ones carried any value. So its list is **filtered to what the
vocabulary carries** before it is shown.

**Filtered on the way to the page, never on the way to disk.** The artifact keeps every tag the model
returned — that is `tagging`'s requirement and it is untouched — because narrowing what is *stored*
would make the record disagree with what the model said, and the reason the artifact exists is to be
able to look behind the sorter. What changes is only which of those tags the surface spends the
operator's attention on.

#### Scenario: the local list is shown whole and the hosted list is shown filtered
- **Key:** `ui:source:both-tag-lists-are-shown-raw-and-read-only`
- **Layers:** unit
- **WHEN** an input whose tag artifacts contain tags outside the flow's vocabulary is opened
- **THEN** every tag the local tagger scored is present in the response the surface renders
- **AND** only the hosted tags the vocabulary contains are present in it
- **AND** no interaction on either list writes to a draft

#### Scenario: filtering the panel does not filter the artifact
- **Key:** `ui:source:the-artifact-keeps-what-the-panel-drops`
- **Layers:** unit
- **WHEN** a hosted tag outside the vocabulary is withheld from the payload
- **THEN** that tag is still present in the stored artifact, unchanged

### Requirement: Vocabulary membership is decided by the server, not by the browser

The system SHALL resolve, for each hosted tag, whether the flow's pinned vocabulary contains it and what
its post count is; SHALL use that to decide which of them reach the page; and SHALL deliver the count
with the input's own payload rather than through a per-tag query.

Membership is what makes the hosted list worth showing at all. Unfiltered it was measured at roughly
one usable tag in ten, and an operator reading nine unusable ones to find the tenth is spending
attention on the busiest pane in the surface. The count travels with each tag that survives, because a
number is what distinguishes a suggestion Danbooru can actually render from one a model merely said.

The tag search endpoint answers a **fragment query** and has no membership form, so deciding this in
the browser would be one round trip per tag. The vocabulary is already resolved at startup and already
held by the process that assembles this payload; the decision costs one dictionary lookup per tag and
no request at all.

#### Scenario: the server decides which hosted tags reach the page, and sends their counts
- **Key:** `ui:source:vocabulary-membership-is-marked-by-the-server`
- **Layers:** unit
- **WHEN** an input with a hosted tag artifact is requested
- **THEN** the payload carries only the tags the vocabulary contains, each with its post count
- **AND** the surface makes no additional request to resolve any of them

### Requirement: A tag artifact that is absent is silent

The system SHALL render the source pane without a tag list when its artifact does not exist, SHALL NOT
refuse to open the surface for the absence, and SHALL NOT display a message explaining it.

There are three legitimate ways for one to be missing — a run captioned before the stage existed, a flow
that declares no hosted model, and a tagger call that failed — and none of them is a reason a sheet
cannot be reviewed. The tag lists are an aid; a surface that refuses to open because an aid is missing
has confused an aid for an input, and the startup refusals exist for what review genuinely cannot proceed
without: the flow, the run, the draft, the photograph's dimensions, the vocabulary and the bundle.

No message either. A line explaining an absence the operator caused by not running something is chrome
on the pane he spends the most time reading, and it would appear for every input of every flow that can
never have one.

#### Scenario: an input with no tag artifacts still opens
- **Key:** `ui:source:an-absent-tag-artifact-is-silent`
- **Layers:** unit
- **WHEN** an input whose run holds no tag artifacts is opened
- **THEN** the surface serves it and the payload reports the lists as absent
- **AND** no refusal is raised and no explanatory message is rendered
