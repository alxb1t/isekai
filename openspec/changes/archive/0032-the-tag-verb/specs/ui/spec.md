## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: A missing caption is shown with the command that writes it

The system SHALL, when an input's flow holds no caption, show in the source pane that there is none and
the command that writes it, naming the flow and the run. It SHALL NOT refuse to open the surface for the
absence.

**The prose is the one artifact a skipped verb leaves missing on a page under review.** The tag lists keep
their silence: a list is missing because a tagger failed, because the run predates it, or because the flow
declares no tagger. Skipping `tag` never reaches review, because the sheet refuses without a tag list the
flow declares.

The caption is now its own verb and nothing downstream needs it, so an input can reach review having never
been read. A blank pane cannot be told from a photograph with nothing to say, and the one-verb design kept
the caption bundled for exactly that reason; naming the command keeps the reason without the bundle.

The server builds the command, as it builds every other command a refusal prints, and it names the run so
it works when pasted.

#### Scenario: an input with no caption names the command that writes it
- **Key:** `ui:source:a-missing-caption-names-its-command`
- **Layers:** unit
- **WHEN** an input whose flow holds no caption is opened
- **THEN** the payload carries no prose and the command that writes it, naming the flow and the run
- **AND** the surface serves the input without a refusal
