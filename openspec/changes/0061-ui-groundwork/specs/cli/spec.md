## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: Every stage verb requires the flows it acts on, and takes more than one

**Reason:** its last clause made the serving verb take exactly one flow; the serving verb now takes no flow at all,
and a requirement cannot drop a scenario in place.

**Migration:** the stage verbs' rule is unchanged, under *A stage verb requires the flows it acts on, and takes more
than one*, with the same scenario keys. The serving verb's arguments are the `ui` capability's *The surface serves
one library, from a verb that takes no arguments*.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: A stage verb requires the flows it acts on, and takes more than one

The system SHALL require a flow selection on every stage verb — reading, tagging, filling a sheet, reviewing,
approving and rendering — SHALL accept the selection more than once in a single invocation, and SHALL refuse an
invocation that names none, naming the flows that are tracked. It SHALL NOT fall back to every tracked
flow. It SHALL refuse a flow that is not tracked, at the point of selection, naming the flows that are.

The flow supplies what a stage reads — its briefing, its schema, its graph and its dials — so a stage cannot act
without one, and every tracked flow is an unbounded default that spends at the last verb. The selection repeats
because flows batch: every flow named in one rendering invocation shares one boot. The serving verb is not a stage
verb: it serves every tracked flow of every batch, and its page selects one.

#### Scenario: a stage verb without a flow is refused
- **Key:** `cli:flow-selection:a-stage-verb-requires-a-flow`
- **Layers:** unit
- **WHEN** a stage verb is invoked with no flow named
- **THEN** the invocation is refused
- **AND** the message lists the tracked flows

#### Scenario: the selection repeats
- **Key:** `cli:flow-selection:the-flag-is-repeatable`
- **Layers:** unit
- **WHEN** a stage verb is given more than one flow
- **THEN** every named flow is acted on in that one invocation
- **AND** no named flow is silently dropped

#### Scenario: every stage verb accepts it
- **Key:** `cli:flow-selection:every-stage-verb-accepts-it`
- **Layers:** unit
- **WHEN** each stage verb — `caption`, `tag`, `sheet`, `review`, `approve` and `generate` — is invoked
  with a flow named
- **THEN** none of them rejects the flag as unrecognised
- **AND** the inspection verb is the only one that does not take it

#### Scenario: an untracked flow is refused at selection
- **Key:** `cli:flow-selection:an-untracked-flow-is-refused`
- **Layers:** unit
- **WHEN** a stage verb names a flow that is not tracked
- **THEN** the invocation is refused naming that flow
- **AND** the message lists the flows that are tracked

#### Scenario: one flow's refusal leaves the input's other flows
- **Key:** `cli:flow-selection:one-flows-refusal-leaves-the-others`
- **Layers:** unit
- **WHEN** a stage verb names more than one flow, and one of them refuses for an input
- **THEN** the input's other named flows are still acted on
- **AND** every refusal is reported together at the end
